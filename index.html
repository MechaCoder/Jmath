			<p>Welcome to Jmaths here we offer a set of tools that work to assist in the teaching and studing of the Japansses meathod of mulipcation, in the United Kingdom the teaching of muilpication is the brutal art of drumming in what is commonly known as timetables and many students find it diffcult to remeber all the times tables which can have distrmental effect on those students, the support for this diffculty is not very well documented or resources avilibale to support those student (i should say that i do not blame teachers or adminstrator it is something that happens in trade like teachering).</p>
			<br />
			<p>while is required that students learn muliplacation it dose not say that they must learn the timestables persay only that they need to be able to prove that they can mulipie numbers and do it conftatably, this system provides a simple to work system that is Extendable and works 100% of the time provide you 'Zone' the groups Proparly</p>
